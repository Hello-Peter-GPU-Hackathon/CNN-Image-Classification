## About The Project

This is a CNN model built with Tensorflow for binary classification of images. It is a part of India Academia Connect AI Hackathon. 

Dataset contains Training and testing sets. 

Training dataset folder - NON TEXT images are stored in 'background' sub folder and TEXT images are stored in 'hi' sub folder.

Test dataset folder - Contains both TEXT and NON-TEXT images to be classified with label 1 for TEXT images and label 0 for NON_TEXT images.
